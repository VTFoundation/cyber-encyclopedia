# Virus (aka Computer Virus)

A computer virus is a sort of malware that attaches itself to another program and can replicate and propagate once it has been installed on a user’s computer. When a computer changes the way in which it should work normally, it is said to be infected by a virus. This virus may spread from one computer to another. For example, you may receive an email with a harmful attachment, inadvertently open the file, and the computer virus then infects your machine. Or in other words, a harmful software application that is installed without the user’s knowledge/ consent on their computer and then performs some malicious acts is known as a virus. A virus attaches itself to another software, once infected the system, in such a way that the host program’s execution activates the virus’s actions simultaneously. It has the ability to self-replicate itself into other programs or files and infecting them. Computer viruses are harmful but the majority of them engage in malicious activity, such as data destruction.
